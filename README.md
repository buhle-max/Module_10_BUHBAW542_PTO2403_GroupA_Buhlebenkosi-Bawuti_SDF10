## [SDF10] API Learning Reflection ðŸ§ 

Welcome to the [SDF10] API Learning Reflection! Through this exercise, you will reflect on key concepts, practical experiences, and the tools you've encountered or used in API interactions.

1. **Understanding and Application**: Reflecting on the key concepts, can you explain in your own words what an API is and its significance in software development? Provide an example of how you have used or encountered an API in a project or a practical scenario.

[The most basic way i can explain what an API is, that it is a software that allows two programs to communicate to each other. For example Uber eats, when i order food i have to pay so the way API is implemented it calls a backing app for a transaction. then when the order is coming, the API is implemented by calling a GPS so that it allows the user to see where their order is. Basically API is like a bridge between two apps that allows them to work together for the benefit of the user.

2. **Conceptual Distinctions**: How would you differentiate between an interface and an API? 

[Basically an interface sets rules on how different components should interact with a system. While an API focuses on how applications should interect within a network]

3. **Components and Types of APIs**: Can you identify the main components of an API and describe their roles? Reflect on the different types of APIs mentioned (e.g., Web APIs, RESTful APIs) and discuss which type you find most intriguing or useful, and why.

[Some of the APIs i can identify Endpoints which are urls for accessing API resources, Methods Actions like POST, DELETE, Authentication and Authorization that verifies and identifies if someone has permission to enter  

4. **Practical Application and Tools**: Reflect on your experience with API exploration and implementation. Have you used any specific tools (such as Curl or API exploration tools) or libraries to interact with APIs? 

[I used a geographical API which tells me my location, I asked it for my longitutde and altitude and also i used a feature which told me that if i were to walk from my house to lady liberty at 5km per hour then it would tak 106 days assuming if there was a road ]

5. **Learning and Improvement**: Considering the key concepts and your practical experiences, identify one area related to APIs where you feel confident and one area where you see a need for improvement. What steps will you take to enhance your understanding and skills in the area you wish to improve?

[The API makes me feel informed on how applications work together as i was confused. The part were i would need help would be applying it to code and how and when to use it.]
